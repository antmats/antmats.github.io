## About Me

I am a final-year PhD candidate in machine learning at Chalmers University of Technology, specializing in interpretable machine learning for modeling and evaluating clinical decision making. Graduating in summer 2025, I'm excited to bring my expertise in machine learning and data analysis to an industry role. My goal is to contribute to the development and deployment of robust, human-centered AI systems that drive meaningful impact in real-world applications.
